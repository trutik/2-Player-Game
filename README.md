# 2PlayerGame

In this university project we were given a single player Asteroids game and asked to add another player by using Java RMI and adding the required game logic. We were awarded bonus marks for adding dead reckoning (player movement prediction to reduce requests to server), interest management (showing the player only what they needed, improving performance) and an artificial delay (to simulate network problems in games, achieved by a simple sleep call).
